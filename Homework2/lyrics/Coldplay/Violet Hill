Violet Hill Lyrics
It was a long and dark December, from the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember from the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured by a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know?
Was a long and dark December when the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto Bibles hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armor when I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

If you love me
Won't you let me know?


I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship would stow
Far below

So if you love me
Why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to Violet Hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know?You might also like
