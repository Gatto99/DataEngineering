Rastafarian Targaryen LyricsGame of what now?
I'm a rastafarian, Targaryen
I got some dragons and they're
Very scary and
Been here and there and then I've
Been everywhere again
Rastafarian, Targa...
Call me Daenerys Targaryen
When you wanna reach me
And if you feel the love
Then you can call me Khaleesi
Got so many names
I'm Queen of the Andals
Queen of the Meereen
Yeah ! You can kiss m' sandalsYou might also like
