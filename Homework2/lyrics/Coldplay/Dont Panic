Don’t Panic Lyrics
Bones, sinking like stones
All that we fought for
Homes, places we’ve grown
All of us are done for

We live in a beautiful world
Yeah, we do, yeah, we do
We live in a beautiful world
Bones, sinking like stones
All that we fought for
Homes, places we’ve grown
All of us are done for

And we live in a beautiful world
Yeah, we do, yeah, we do
We live in a beautiful world

And we live in a beautiful world
Yeah, we do, yeah, we do
We live in a beautiful world


Oh, all that I know
There's nothing here to run from
'Cause yeah, everybody here's
Got somebody to lean onYou might also like
