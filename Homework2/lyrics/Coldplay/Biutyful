Biutyful Lyrics
All I know
Is I love you so

I hope that you get everything you want in this beautiful life
Change for your pocket, someone for the night
I hope they name you a rocket, take you for a ride for free
And if they tell you, you're nothing, maybe you'd explain
To me, you're the summer sun after the rain
You were there when I needed something for the pain, you see
When you love me, love me, lovе me
When you love mе, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
I'm nowhere else
I'm on top of the world, man
On top of the world

And it's so beautiful
And you're so beautiful

I hope that you get everything you want in this beautiful life
Watermelon moon, so happy you're alive
And I feel like a river, finally arrived at sea

Cause when you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
I know I'll be
On top of the world, man
On top of the world
You might also like
And it's so beautiful
And you're so beautiful
And it's so beautiful

Cause when you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
I know I'll be
On top of the world, man
On top of the world

And it's so beautiful
And you're so beautiful
And it's so beautiful
And you're so beautiful
And it's so beautiful
