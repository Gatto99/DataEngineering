Cemeteries of London Lyrics
At night they would go walking 'til the breaking of the day
The morning is for sleeping
Through the dark streets they go searching to see God in their own way
Save the nighttime for your weeping
Your weeping

Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
And the night over London lay
So we rode down to the river where Victorian ghosts pray
For their curses to be broken
We go wander 'neath the arches where the witches are and they say
"There are ghost towns in the ocean"
The ocean

Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
And the night over London lay


God is in the houses and God is in my head
And all the cemeteries of London
I see God come in my garden but I don’t know what he said
For my heart it wasn’t open
Not open

Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
And the night over London lay
Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
There’s no light over London todayYou might also like
