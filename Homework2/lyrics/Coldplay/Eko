Èkó Lyrics
Ah-hmm

Joseph rode in on a beam of light
Stray dogs to welcome him, fights, corrugate cathedrals
The sight of the pilgrims going nowhere in millions of cars

Lagos a dream in the distance
From promises he'd made behind
Where there was no harvest
But he missed the sky and its circus
And countless, the stars
In Africa
The rivers are perfectly deep
And beautifully wide
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say, "It's alright, child
It's alright"

Yeah
Ah-hmm
Ah-hmm

In Africa
We dance in the water and hold
Each other so tight
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say, "It's alright, child
It's alright"

Joseph rode in on a beam of light
And dreamed of his queen by his side
There'll be a beautiful sunset
And you'll be a beautiful brideYou might also like
