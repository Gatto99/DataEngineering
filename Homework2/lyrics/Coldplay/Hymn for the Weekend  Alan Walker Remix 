Hymn for the Weekend (Alan Walker Remix) Lyrics
I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Drunk, so high, so high

Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood
I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (High)
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (So high)
(High, high, high)

Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love's about
To make the stars come out

Drink from me, drink from me
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (High)
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (So high)
(High, high, high)

I-Oh-I-Oh-I
La, la, la, la, la, la
So high, so high
I-Oh-I-Oh-I
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the...
That I shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the... (Let me shoot across the)
Let me shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the...
Let me shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the...
