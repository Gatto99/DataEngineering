Humankind Lyrics
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

Today I heard the strangest
I heard the strangest song
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
A DJ a star away is
Playing it to turn us on
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
My heart started glowing
I feel it inside, it's flowing

I say, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're designed, yeah
Oh, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
But from another planet
Still they call us humankind

Today I had the strangest
Feeling that I belong
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)

Before I was dying
I feel it inside, now I'm flying

I say, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're designed, yeah
Oh, I know, I know, I know
We'rе only human
But from another planet
Still they call us humankind
You might also like
Oh
Alright

Bеfore I was dying
I feel it inside, now I'm flying

I know, I know, I know
We're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're designed
Oh, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
But we're capable of kindness
So they call us humankind
