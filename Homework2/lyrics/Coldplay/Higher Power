Higher Power Lyrics
Three, two, one

Sometimes I just can't take it
Sometimes I just can't take it and it isn't alright
I'm not gonna make it
And I think my shoe's untied (Ooh-ooh)
I'm like a broken record
I'm like a broken record and I'm not playin' right
Drocer nekorb a ekil mi
'Til you tell me on your heavenly phone
To hold tight (Hold tight)
Come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Yeah, don't let go, oh, oh, oh-oh
Hold tight (Hold tight), hold tight (Hold tight)
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
"It's alright, it's alright", you said
I've got my hands up shakin' just to let you know

That you've got a higher power
Got me singin' every sеcond, dancin' every hour
Oh yeah, you'vе got a higher power
And you're really someone I wanna know, ooh

This boy is electric
This boy is electric and you're sparklin' like the universe connected
And I'm buzzin' night after night after night (Oh-oh)
This joy is electric
This joy is electric and you're circuiting through
I'm so happy that I'm alive
Happy I'm alive at the same time as you
You might also like
'Cause you've got a higher power
Got me singin' every second, dancin' every hour
Oh yeah, you've got a higher power
And you're really someone I wanna know
(I wanna know, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)

You've got, yeah, you've got a higher
You've got, yeah, you've got a higher
You've got, yeah, you've got a higher
You've got, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
You've got, oh, you've got a high
You've got, yeah, you've got a higher
You've got, oh, you've got a high
My hands up shaking just to let you know now

You've got a higher power
You've got me singin' every second, dancin' any hour
Oh yeah, you've got a higher power
You're once in any lifetime
I'm going a million miles an hour

When for so long, I'd been down on my knees
Then your love song saved me over and over
For so long, I'd been down on my knees
'Til your love song floats me on
Ee-oh, oh-oh
