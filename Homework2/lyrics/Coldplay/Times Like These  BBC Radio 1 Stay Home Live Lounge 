Times Like These (BBC Radio 1 Stay Home Live Lounge) Lyrics
I, I'm a one way motorway
I'm the one that drives away, then follows you back home
And I, I'm a street light shinin'
I'm a wild light blinding bright, burning off alone, oh-oh-oh

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these we give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these, time and time again, oh-oh-oh
I, I'm a new day rising
I'm a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight
I, I am a little divided
Do I stay or run away and leave it all behind?

I know
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these, time and time again (Again)

Let's go, it's times like these that we activate
Do something to improve, don't procrastinate (Oh)
I been cooking now, make a wicked pasta plate
Stream games at 11 but I clap at eight (It's time like these)
And I'll drink on FaceTime if you tempt me
Time to pay back all the health docs lent me (Oh)
And for me West 10's elementary
But right now I wanna see Ladbroke Grove empty, you get me?
We make it better together we'll make a better life
Because the pressure is ever upon us every night
And everyday so we pray and we will forever fight
We'll make it better together, we'll make a better life

I, I'm a one way motorway
I'm the one that drives away, then follows you back home, mm-mm-hm
I, I'm a street light shining (Ooh)
I'm a wild light blinding bright, burnin' off alone
(Alone, alone, ooh)

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again
It's times like these you learn to live again

It's times like these you learn to love again
